# Discord.js v13 music example

This repository is made for helping people understand how to use `voice` in discord.js v13!
This package focuses only on **music** and not any other features.

Before you do use this package make sure to check out their [guide](https://discordjs.guide/voice/#installation) on v13 voice! We used it to create this bot too.

### **How to use the code?**

> You will need `.env` file in which you will have your credentials(token, etc.) that is pretty much it!

> Prefix is `&` if you want to know
